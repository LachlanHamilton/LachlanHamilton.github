Developed numerical simulations of ideal models of criticality with the random field Ising model, and compared the observed dynamics to single-cell resolution calcium imaging data of the zebrafish brain. We investigated how sub-sampling and finite sized systems change self-organized criticality metrics such as power laws and universal scale.
